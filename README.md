## the vigilant round app
so i was doing a vigilant round at my job but the screen was too bright with Google Keep, so i thought about making my own app with a darker theme and practice my CSS/ React Skills

#### made using Vite
to make the app very quick and private it only uses LocalStorage for data persistance. Check out the demo:
